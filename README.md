### What I learned

Throughout the development process, I acquired new skills and knowledge, some of which include mastering gradient backgrounds and effectively utilizing multiple box-shadows. Here's an example of the code I used:

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.circle.win {
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 25px #ffffff1c, 0px 0px 2px 65px #ffffff14,
    0px 0px 0px 100px #ffffff08 !important;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Gradient background](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient) - One resource that greatly assisted me was the Gradient background documentation on MDN Web Docs. This guide enabled me to create stunning gradient backgrounds, a technique I plan to leverage in future projects.
